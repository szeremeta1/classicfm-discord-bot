# classicfm-discord-bot
A bot that constantly streams ClassicFM, a British classical music radio station, into a Discord voice channel of the user's choosing.

This bot uses an **m3u8** stream as its source and joins a channel of the user's choosing until it is forcefully disconnected. This can be helpful if you want to just make a voice channel for peacefully listening to classical music, and **it can be used with any mp3 or m3u8 stream**. 

To use the bot, type ``!livestream`` into any text channel that the bot can access while you are in a voice channel that the bot can access.

Like any other bot, this requires that you make an application (bot) in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

This mini project quite literally would not have been possible without [@ChrisChrome](https://github.com/ChrisChrome), who basically made the whole fucking thing work and showed me the limitations of both Discord bots and JavaScript as a whole.
